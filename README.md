# Car dealer

We want to create a list of car dealer shops.

## Services
We have a CarService that is responsible for the saving and retrieving of car data.
The CarDealerService is responsible for the saving and retrieving of the Dealer information.

## Exercise
- Create the Dealer class.
- Look at the Brand class. Why would you choose an Enum (https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_enums.asp) here?
- Implement the methods in the CarDealerServiceImpl.
  - Use the carService to retrieve data about cars.
- Make sure that all the tests are working. (And correct.)
- In the main class:
  - Add two dealers:
    - Van Mossel 
    - Louwman
  - Van Mossel has the following cars:
    - 2 Tesla's
    - 3 Renault's
  - Louwman has the following cars:
    - 2 Toyota's
    - 4 Ford's
  - Prove that all the other methods are working as well. 

## TIP 
Write down what you want to achieve if you have problems with following the flow. 
It may seem as a lot of information packed together, but writing/drawing will help you with forming a clear picture.
